         Some of our image were digitally design by using Canva, ensuring high-quality and visually appealing work that really tells the unique personalities of our team members and other things as well. 
         The layout on our web pages were all code via sizes, positions and looks by a Flexbox container to create a multi-column display.It ensures consistency and elegance for our content to be seen across the internet and all devices. 
         We study and research the expertise of W3Schools for best practices on HTML and CSS for coding to ensure a clean, functional, and responsive website like any other.
         ChatGPT provided excellent informational content based on our main avatar. It whats helps us get to know more about the main topic of this site so that the others can learn as well.
